Life of a delivered Man

S - Mar 1:44  and said to him, “See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to them.” 
Mar 1:45  But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in desolate places, and people were coming to him from every quarter. 

	

T - Jesus can do anything for You for he has the power to do so. One of the Key on with man of leprosy why He was healed, because he came to jesus and ask for healing. A move that he should have gathered all the strength and  shameless because of hi condition. 
	- You know why God do not anything until we ask? because if He is the would ask us, what would be our answer?
	- if GOd randomly asked you, what can I do for you? I think we all would pause for a moment and think about it. Most of the time we asked something we dont really need and out of impulsive decision.
	- that is why God need to from us what we want to have.
  - A lepper man did not contain the Joy that is why He began to talk freely about the good news.
	- kapag may nagawang kamangha manga sayo ang diyos hindi mo talaga mapipigilan na ito ay hindi ipag sabi.
	- ikaw sa tingin mo ano mga bagay na nagawa ng diyos s buhay mo pero hindi mo ito nasabi sa iba?


A - Many times of my life I am acting like God did not do something grate about mylife. I just let it passed thinking that my story would not have an impact to others like a nobody. This verse taught me that even a nobody could be somebody once He experience the Power of God in His life and that Power through HOly sipirt we could share the goodness of God.


R - I wanna be a person that life has an impact to others. I am not desiring to be famous but atleast have a heart to help those people less fortunate than I am. May God transform into that kind of Person.
