## Change is essential

__"Neither is new wine put into old wineskins. If it is, the skins burst and the wine is spilled and the skins are destroyed. But new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved."- Matthew 9:14__


* Nothing is constant in this world but CHANGE. Even the intelligent people in this world is accepting that CHANGE is the only constant in this world but many doesnt want change in their life?

* There are different reasons why people dont want change perhaps for some it is too risky, too difficult. too mush effort.
Do not expect different result if you are doing same thing over and over again. that is applicable to those people who are expecting to be good does nothing to improve.

* at some there is a progress in repeatedness in the aspect of practicing a new skill, new learning and new habit.

* if we want to God manifest in our life we need to change our lifestyle accordance to his will.
