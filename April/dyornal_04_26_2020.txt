wanna be? start on being good soil.


S - Mar 4:20  But those that were sown on the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold

T - All the good soil will be fruit. it doesnt matter how long it takes as long as it is a good soil there are fruits that will come out of it.

A - I too far for being a good soil, if I will evaluate my life right now. I more likely a rocky and thorns one. 
	- I am a rocky because sometimes I received the word of God with fullness of Joy, but everytime the trouble comes joy immediately taken away and I always forgot to acknowledge that there is a God who has everything is in control.
	- I am also a soil with thorns, because I get easily distracted when there are things that I want to have and I put too much attention to it. I forgot that GOd is the God of provisions that I dont need to overthink what my future may have as long as I am with God I am secure.

R - I wanna be the good soil. there are a lot of things that I want to change in my life. I wanna be the person who hold the word of God grows in it as I will bear fruit even if it not much fruit. as long as I know that I am growing in the Word of God I can renounce that I am a good soil

Random Thoughts 

Mar 4:24  And he said to them, “Pay attention to what you hear: with the measure you use, it will be measured to you, and still more will be added to you. 

	- kung ikaw ay magiging ilaw para sa salita ng diyos laging maging maingat sa kung ano mang salita na magmumula sa iyong bibig dahil maraming tao ang pwde sa iyo makinig. ang gamit lamang ng kanilang pag unawa sa iyong sinabi ay base lang din kung anong pang unawa nila. 
	- kung dumating ang panahon na hindi nila maunawaan ang iyong sinabi o nagbunga ito ng masamang epekto sa kanila. una mong suriin kung mali ba talaga ang iyong nasabi kung hindi naman ay huwag hayaan na humantong pa ito sa hindi pag kaka unawaan. lalo kung ito ay kapatiran. inyo itong pag usapan.
