# Head turner Faith


**S** - *Mar 5:30" And Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone out from him,
		immediately turned about in the crowd and said, 'Who touched my garments?'"*

**T** - God knows if your plead to Him has faith in it or you just pleading out of
 your emotion, we cannot fool God for he knows even the deepest plead of our heart.
	  - When does God turn his attention to you pleading? I am not saying that
he is just looking for the big request but when was the last you made God give
his attention to you pleading? is it because you are good? is it because you
didn't miss a day doing your devotion? No, He gave you his attention because of
your Faith in him for believing in him despite of what is happening in you reality.

**A** - Many times in my life I looked for alternative solution to my problem tried
to refer to many things that I thought what would be the answer to my pleading to God
	  - Since I wanna have change in my life I did not notice that I looking at wrong
solution and if my solution I always ending up barking a wrong asking God why did he 
permit someting like that to happen not knowing in the first place I was the looked
for an alternative to my plead.

**R** - I wanna have faith that can turn the attention of God to grant it according to
His will and purpose
	  - while I am pleading I also wanna have the discernemnt if my request to the will
	  of God. 
	  - I will reflect now to that God wants me to be interms of Faith. I am too far for
	  having a faith that can move a mountain.

__rand__ - kung yung Legion nanghihingi ng persimission kay Hesus para lang wag palayasin
sa lugar at pumasok na lang sa baboy. ikaw naka ilang desisyon ka sa buhay mo ng 
hindi dumaan sa pag tatanong kung kalooban ba to ng diyos o hindi? wag ganon omat. haha
