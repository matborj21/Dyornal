The three soldiers returning home from war were hungry.
When they saw the village ahead their spirits lifted—they were
sure the villagers would give them a meal. But when they got
there, they found the doors locked and the windows closed.
After many years of war, the villagers were short of food, and
hoarded what they had.
Undeterred, the soldiers boiled a pot of water and carefully
placed three stones into it. The amazed villagers came out to
watch.
“This is stone soup,” the soldiers explained. “Is that all you put
in it?” asked the villagers. “Absolutely—although some say it
tastes even better with a few carrots…” A villager ran of ,
returning in no time with a basket of carrots from his hoard.
A couple of minutes later, the villagers again asked “Is that it?”
“Well,” said the soldiers, “a couple of potatoes give it body.” Of
ran another villager.
Over the next hour, the soldiers listed more ingredients that
would enhance the soup: beef, leeks, salt, and herbs. Each time
a different villager would run of to raid their personal stores.
Eventually they had produced a large pot of steaming soup.
The soldiers removed the stones, and they sat down with the
entire village to enjoy the first square meal any of them had
eaten in months.
