Decaying Life


"Behold, I am against you, says Jehovah of Hosts; and I will uncover your skirts upon your face. And I will cause the nations to see your nakedness, and the kingdoms your shame." - Nahum 3:5


We all know that the christian life is not that easy as you think, there is a lot of self battle that needs to overcome and pursue the life of righteousness in the eyes of God.Be careful in our walk in christian for as the bible says 'we are battling not the flesh but in the spirit and our enemy is domininating this world and he is the prince of the air'.

How will you fight a good fight of faith if in the first place if you can't overcome yourself. How will you help other and lead them if you can't lead yourself.I am not saying that before you lead people, you don't need to have sinless life. It will never happen but still it is not a license to purposely sinning against God.

Always remember that 'for the wages of sin is death'(Romans 6:23) and the bible is a serious in implying consequences to those people who continue to their sins

Don't wait for God's wrath like saying in this verse (Nahum 3:5). We read many times how he warn these people of Nineveh to repent still they continue their carnal life. A life that is against in the principles and commandment of God.


This World is already decaying don't live your life as one in the streams of this world. what are the things that maybe decaying already in your life that needs salvation by the Grace of God?


D - eadly sin
	- we know the 7 deadly sins that describing in the bible. if you think that you have atleast one those sins. have a TRUE repentance and renounce the power of the Blood of Jesus

E - go
	- sometimes we dont want God to touch our Ego because we have something to protect in our life that dont the peopl to know.
	- if you want something to protect. Protect the name of JESUS in your life. it is better that protecting your EGO

C - areer
	- the Problem with people that has so many dreams is they forget to include the dream of God over their personal Dream.
	- Pursue God's dream in your life and you personal dream will follow.
A - nointing
	- watch out for yourself maybe you are not sinning but still you dont an anointing that comes from the Grace of God.

Y - Young in faith
	- are still have a child like faith? or you already have an attitude like you that already and dont to grow anymore
	- a child like faiht is also having a heart still longing to improve not just to be inocent coz a chil needs to take care of a parent and your parent is none other than God himself.



I pray and I hope at the end of my life I can bodlesly declare that I have fought the good fight of faith in my life time. 

1 Timothy 6:12
