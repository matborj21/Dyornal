Walk with integrity

"For all peoples will walk, each one in the name of his god; 
and we will walk in the name of Jehovah our God forever and ever." - Micah 4:5

In the course of life we have a different path to take and different people to blend but one thing that we cannot take lightly
is the course of Crhistian life.
The conquest of being Christian is too tough to take it for granted and you need always to be prepare for what may happens
there are people behind our back and have put their Hope, Faith, Beliefs and even invest their Life to us.
For the particular reason the hardest part of what we can do is to give up.

Start walking seriously in Faith
    - You are already part of the Body of Christ and peopl already know that you are CHRISTian you live like ONE!
    - Live the life like the way that Jesus Live his life.
    - You must part take into human neccesssity you are here to give support to others.

Start Giving Reason other to believe you
    - People have different belief and sometimes you will encounter a person who will force their belief in you. Be careful where you stand for.
    - When Peopl saw that you are convicted in you belief it will manifest it in your life. When time comes that the fruit of holy spirit mnanifest 
    in your life and that will be the time that you already influence them through your life.

You will only live once in this Life make sure to live your life to fullness of the Grace of GOd.
