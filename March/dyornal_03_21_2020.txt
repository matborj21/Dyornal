Are you ready when said "go"?


Amos 3:7-8

"For the Lord Jehovah will do nothing unless He reveals His secret to His servants the prophets. 
The lion has roared; who will not fear? The Lord Jehovah has spoken; who will not prophesy?"

When is at work who can stop it? when God plan something it will make sure to be executed. the question is how are you?

are you the one that God is looking for? are you ready to be used by the almighty God? if you are then what are you waiting for? be someone that can be use in the kingdom of God

if you want to be use by God. you need to protect yourself first.
protect you identity in Christ - 
	- you are a son not a mere servant
	- you have the rights in his name (jesus)
	- you are an ambassador of Christ
	- you are a minister of the Word

protect your relationship  with Christ - 
	- pray without ceasing
	- meditate his word until you have a rhema from him
	- seek him first in everything you do.
	- love him until your last breath.


I want to be use by God in a useful manner. dont need to be in the spotlight of servanthood. i just want to be useful by God in everything I do.
