No excuse to be useful

"The vision of Obadiah.
This is what the Sovereign LORD says about Edom —
We have heard a message from the LORD:
An envoy was sent to the nations to say,
“Rise, let us go against her for battle” — Obadiah 1:1


Obadiah is shortest chapter in the old testament yet God used him deliver the message that needed to be on the people of Israel.

If you think that God cant use you because you haven't done much then you are in the wrong perspective of Christianity. We are always taught that God uses weak to shame the strong

You need two things in order to use by God

	• An ear that is always ready to hear from God
	• A mouth that is always ready to share what you heard from God

Let the crisis make you better  yourself than yesterday you don’t need to rash things to be done.
Grow your faith one belief at a time
Grow your live one person at a time
It doesn’t matter slow you are what matters is you are growing deeper with your relationships with the Lord
