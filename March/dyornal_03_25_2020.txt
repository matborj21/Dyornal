Excesive Faith can lead to destruction?

"And he prayed to Jehovah and said, Please, O Jehovah, was this not my saying when I was still in my land? On account of this I fled before to Tarshish. For I knew that You are a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and One who repents over calamity. " - Jonah 4:2


When was the last time that you were amazed by GOd? the time you are overly joyed because he reveal something in you. the feeling that you are being closer and closer to God coz the bible says 'when you seek me with all your heart, you will find me'.The more you know GOd the more you are closing to him and did want more of his presence, more of his promise, more of his mercy. but when the time you stop growing you relation to God it is the time stop being amazed Great he is.

when I said in the title that Excesive faith can lead to destruction? it is not actually the faith it is the familiarity because you are too familiar with God 
on what he was done how a gracious God he is, and merciful, slow to anger and all that characteristic of God did not change. want know did change? you stop on growing your relationship on him.

In a worldly manner relation someone could say that over the years it is norm to be too familiar with your partner. You never get excited on seing that person when you are coming home from work, school, etc. We all know that when relationship gets too familar it gets too boring. when it gets too boring thats when your focus now is on the problem inside the relationship instead on the solution. you easily gets tire of the person and sometimes it could lead it into brokeness.

why am I saying this? because thats what happen to Jonah he tried to fled before God he saying all the traits of God. we can compare our situation with God maybe you recite all the bible verses and all traits of God and yet we did not saw Heart of God.

*Pursue the heart of God
	- seek for what God wants. he will is more important than your life plans or life goals.
*God wants them to be saved
	- he can perform miracle that is the truth but without the acknowledgement of his power God he cant exercise his Faith thats how God entrusted prewill on man.
	- the people perish because the lack of wisdom.


you need to be more careful on God's heart more than on what he can do. because all the traits about God comes from the heart of God.
