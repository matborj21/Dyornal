Stand for Who you are

"Then the seamen were afraid, and each man cried to his god. And they threw out the ship's articles in the ship, into the sea in order to lighten it. But Jonah had gone down into the hold of the ship; and he lay there, and was fast asleep." -- Jonah 1:5


Jonah's life is a very familliar passage because when we talked about Jonah we are all remembering that he is a man tried to flee from GOd's commamand and we all know that in the end he cant but to obey God.

There is one thing I want to focus on this verse that everyone cried out to their own God they have done anything in order to lighten the ship because the storm and here is Jonah laying was fast asleep. In this kind of situation it is impossible that no on can notice him for being too calm or maybe he just know that it is all happening because of him like we can read on the succeeding verses.

* Your calmness sometimes is being neglectful (jonah 1:5)

	- be careful when you are too calm in the midst of the adversities sometimes you are not aware that you are just being neglectful for what is happening in your surrounding. 
	- make sure that the reason of your being calm is because you are trusting God and not neglecting and just accepting for punishment awaits you.


Another verse that I notice in this chapter is the verse 8 he was asked by the people after the lot fell on Jonah. What is your business? And where do you come from? Where is your country? And of what people are you? and Jonah answered with confidence that he is a Hebrew and He Fear God

* Your Indentity matters ( jonah 1:9 )

	- When people notice how calm you are in the midst of crisis they will try to know who you truly are and they will be interested in your beliefs.
	- make sure that you are standing in the principles of the bible when you are starting to share for who you are
	- the more you are closer to God the more his character will be reflected to you.

in the preceding verse people on the ship are crying to their own God but after they know who truly is they start to the God of Jonah

*Your stand is an influence

	- every people has their own beliefs but all people can stand on their beliefs.
	- standing on the belief no what the situation is can be called great devotion of Faith and that is what matter most to God
	- is stand can influence the people around you? are being persecuted of your belief o are an influencer because you are taking a stand


Every situation has a learning
Every crisis has an ending
and every Christians should on what they are standing.

Stand in faith
Stand in the princilple of the bible!
