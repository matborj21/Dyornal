See Believe & stand

"For the vision is still for an appointed time, but it speaks to the end, and it does not lie. Though it lingers, wait for it; because it will surely come. It will not tarry." - Habakkuk 2:3


When you come to know Jesus and accept him as your personal Lord and savior.
He also gives you a vision that one day you will be any use in the kingdom of God. It doesnt matter on God what are your current abilities and capablities the fact that God entrusted you a vision He knew that if you will keep it, it will surely come.

what is Vision? as per kuya google

	- the ability to think about or plan the future with imagination or wisdom.
	- a vivid mental image, especially a fanciful one of the future.

A vision that come from the Lord is sometime disguising as a Dream, Desire or a concrete plan. Something you wanna build, someone you wanna save, Somewhere you wanna go. The desire that will lead you to God is the something that God want to prevail over your life.

for me "The Vision is the powerful force that pulling us into our destination"

There are three things you need to embrace in order for the VISION of God to manifest in Our life.


See it Clearly
	- You have to see cleary the vison that God putting in your heart. You must look at it as if you are looking at the picture.
	- the more clear the vision, the more clear the direction.

Believe in it Despite of..
	- Continue believing on the Vision despite of there is a lot of things that may hinder it from becoming a reality
	- Believe despite of a lot delays
	- Beleive in it despite of short comings and lack of confidence

Stand for the Vision
	- Peopl will not support for the Vision of the Lord and sometimes you feel the you are only one pursuing it. 
	- do not Stop pursuing the Vision stand on your ground and embrace the grind; surely someday it will come to reality.


Carrying the vision is of the most difficult task in Christian walk yet it is the most fulfilling. Grow yourself and be responsible for your own growth.

A man that doesn' t have a clear vision doesnt have a clear destination


yung pangarap na binigay sayo ng Diyos maaaring lumabo or mawala sa isip mo pero kapag andon kana maiiyak ka sa tuwa dahil hindi binitawwan ng diyos yung pangarap na binigay nya sayo. hindi mo namamalayan nakatungtong kana pala sa pangarap mo. sa pangarap ng Diyos sayo

isa sa natutunan ko kapag nakita mo yung pangarap sa yo ng Diyos at yung ang hinabol mo. susunod sayo yung personal mo pangarap. may bonus pang kasama.
