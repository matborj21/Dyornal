__S__ - _Joh 16:7 Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you._

Joh 16:8  And when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment: 
Joh 16:9  concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; 
Joh 16:10  concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer; 
Joh 16:11  concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.

_Joh 16:12  “I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now._
 - One of the primary reason why we need to depend on Holy Spirit regarding on understanding the Word of God. We will not be able to handle the whole truth our whole lifetime is not enough to grasp the plan of God in our Life so the Holy Spirit became our guide to control the information that comes from the Lord. Depend fully on Him.

 _Joh 16:20  Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy._
  - When circumstances looks like overwhelmimg and sometimes defeating you that is when God turn the sorry into joy. Our defeats in the World are victories into His word.
