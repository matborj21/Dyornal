__A__ - On everyday life we are hearing a different voices and noises that may be our warning, guideline, peace or even could be our destruction. Be careful to whose voice you are listining it be could lead us into our destination or destruction. How will you hear the voice of truth loudly?
 - __Know your sheperd__ - It is impossible for us to follow the voice of truth if in the first place we don't know who is our sheperd.
 - __Trust the sheperd__ - If your know your sheperd you must trust him also. sometimes the instruction does not make sense but if we would just follow our sheperd faithfully it bring us to the place he wants us to go.
 - __Near at the sheperd__ - This is not a suggestion it is a command because the more you are close the sheperd the more clearer His voice it.
