## Hey! Still kicking?

_[Reading guide : Luke 15-16]_

__S__ - _Luk 15:24  For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.’ And they began to celebrate._

__T__ - God showed to us his affection and he expressed by hanging himself on the cross, it is more than enough to live for him cause he died for us and yet we are like a prodigal who became selfish, act to out own accord and neglecting what we have done.

__A__ - Most of the people did not experienc leaving the church and totally turn their back to God. I was once like that and it's a little bit long story. I am grateful he found me and took me back.

I think that is most easiest way to notice since there is a physical involved leaving the church. The most dangerous is those people who did not leave the church and yet acting like dead and lost even they are going on the services or attended religeous activity

Be careful, check yourself if you are still living or just existing.

 - _Dead person_ - Check yourself, are you still alive in the Vision? alive in compassion? alive in your passion? maybe you're just go with the flow since you don't a place to go if you physically on the church. The Good news is God still waiting ready to embrace you.
 - _Lost person_ - Full anxiety, afraid on what lies ahead there's a lot reason to lost but good news it always tak one step to go back.
