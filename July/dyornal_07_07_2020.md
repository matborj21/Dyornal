_Php 1:15  Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will._
 - What drives you to preach the gospel? from envy? because you are way behind to the people you are working with? from rivalry? because you want the first person to complete your 12? from good will? just because you are good and need to influence others to do good also?. The reason why I preach the gospel because I was saved and experience the Love of God personal in my life. I want also people to experience it to their lives.
