_Act 21:13  Then Paul answered, “What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”_
 - Being a disciple is one of the greatest decision you will ever make. It is just like between 0 and 1, either you will give your 100% of your life or you will turnen back from God. Your will not base he conviniency of yor situation, you need to look beyond the current situation and expect not only the blessing but also the testing. The blessings build your attitude, trials build your character.
